# Segment Registers
- ``ds``: Data Segment
- ``es``: Extend Segment
- ``cs``: Code Segment
- ``ss``: Stack Segment
- ``fs`` and ``gs``: General-purpose Segment 

In long-mode, ``ds, es, ss, cs`` are treated as their **base** was $0$ no matter what the descriptor is. The limit check is disabled.

# Paging and Page Table
In long-mode, the size of one address is $64$ bits, but the highest 8 bits are just the copy of the $47$ bit (counting from $0$). Therefore the effective number of digits in a memory address is $48$. 

While the segment memory management is nearly disabled, paging system is used to convert virtual address to physics address, allowing the isolation of processes and giving convenience for implementation of non contiguous memory occupation of one process. Paging divides an virtual address into $5$ parts from higher bits to lower bits. The first $4$ parts are all 9-bit long, and is used as the index of one level of page table. And the last part is $12$-bit long and used as the offset inside page.

In my project, $4$ levels of page table are named from highest level to lowest level as Page Global Directory (PGD), Page Upper Directory (PUD), Page Middle Directory (PMD), Page Lower Directory (PLD).

For one page table, base physics address should be aligned to $4\texttt{KB}$. There are $512$ items, which called "entries", in one pages, each item is a $64$-bit integer. Thus, the size of one page table is $512 \times 8\texttt{B} = 4\texttt{KB}$ .

The structure of items in each level is different. For items of PGD, PUD and PMD, one item contains the pointer (a physics address) to the next level page table, along with some attributes of the memory that managed by this item. While PLD contains the base physics address managed by this page and some attributes. The details of these structures will be shown below.

The address of PGD is stored in register ``CR3``, and ``movq`` can be used to modify and access it. Because of the effect of TLB (a cache for speeding up the convertion), the adjustment of page table may not make effects immediately, but ``movq xxx, %cr3`` can compulsorily flush the TLB.

In some scenarios, PLD would disappear (when the **PS** bit of PMD is set to $0$, which will be introduced later) and the $0...21$-th bits will be directly used as the offset inside page, which means that we use $2\texttt{MB}$ pages instead of $4\texttt{KB}$ pages. In other scenarios, both PLD and PMD would disapper and the $0...30$-th bits will be directly used as the offset inside page

In the initialization period, due to the limitation of space usage, I disable the PLD and use $2\texttt{MB}$ pages instead.

## Description of Items
Let me first introduce the names and meaning of the attribute bits.

- **P**, Present. it should be $1$.
- **R/W**, Read/Write. $1$: Allows to write this memory $0$: Not allowed to write. and this page is read-only
- **U/S**, User/Supervisor. $1$: This page can be accessed by all privilege level. $0$: user is not allowed to use this page.
- **PWT**, Page-level Write-Through. $1$: Write-though caching is enabled. $0$: Write-back is enabled.
- **PCD**, Cache Disable. $1$: This page will not be cached. $0$: will be cached.
- **A**, Accessed. This bit is to shown whether a this item was used during converting, which will be adjust by MMU (the convertion tool of CPU) automatically.
- **D**, Dirty. This bit is used to shown whether a page has been written to.
- **PS**, Page Size. $1$: This item directly maps to a page. $0$: This item leads to a page table of the next level.
- **G**, Global. This bit tells the processor not to invalidate the TLB entry corresponding to the page upon a instruction ``mov`` to ``CR3`` instruction. And the **PGE** bit of ``CR4`` (the $7$-th bit) should be set. In this project, this bit should be $0$. 

PS: I ignore some useless attribute bit.

### PGD
A PGD can manage the whole virtual address space, while one entry of PGD can manage $512\texttt{GB}$ .

- $0$: **P**
- $1$: **R/W**
- $2$: **U/S**
- $3$: **PWT**
- $4$: **PCD**
- $5$: **A**
- $6$: Ignored.
- $7$: **PS**, Reserved and must be $0$.
- $8...10$: Ignored.
- $11$: **R**, something not so important and can will be set to $0$ .
- $12...47$: The $12...47$-th of the $4\texttt{KB}$-aligned address of the PUD referenced by this item.
- $48...62$: From $48...51$-th bits, which are reserved, the values should be $0$. And the $52...62$-th bits are ignored.
- $63$: In this project, this bit should be $0$.

### PUD
- $0...5$: These bits are the same as those of PGD
- $6$: **D**
- $7$: **PS**. $1$: this entry directly maps to a $1\texttt{GB}$ page and then $12$-th bit of this entry is **PAT** bit. $0$: this entry refers to a PMD. During this project, this bit is always $0$.
- $8$: **G**. If **PS** is $0$, then this bit will be ignore. But as what I said before, throughout this project, this bit will be always $0$.
- $9...10$: Ignored.
- $11$: **R**.
- if **PS**=$1$:
  - $12$: **PAT**
  - $13...29$: Reserved and should be $0$.
  - $30...47$: The $30...47$-th bits of the $1\texttt{GB}$-aligned physics page referenced by this entry.
- if **PS**=$0$:
  - $12...47$: The $12...47$-th of the $4\texttt{KB}$-aligned address of the PMD referenced by this item.
- The rest bits are the same as those of PGD.

### PMD
The description of PMD is similar to PUD, so I will not show it again. The only difference is that when **PS**=1, the $21...48$-th bits reference to the $2\texttt{MB}$-aligned physics page.

### PLD
- $0...11$: These bits are the same as those in PGD. But the **PS** bit should be zero.
- $12...47$: The $12...47$-th of the $4\texttt{KB}$-aligned physics page referenced by this entry.
- $47...63$: These bits are the same as those in PGD.

# Memory Management
## Initialization Process
During the initialization period, the kernel program will first use the mapped address space in ``head.S``, whose size is below $512\texttt{MB}$ to build the page table of 'directly mapping address space' (DMAS), and along with the page array, the zone array and the bitmap. The addresses of the elements of these three arrays are contiguous respectively and within the range of DMAS, so the program will first set the zone arrays, then find the valid address space to set the page array and bitmap respectively. 

DMAS is an area whose virtual address is just the physics address added up with an offse. The maximum virtual address space is $[\texttt{0xffff880000000000}, \texttt{0xffffC80000000000}]$, and maximum size is $64\texttt{TB}$. The following equation is the the relationship of the physics address and the virtual address of this space:

$$
\text{physics address}=\text{virtual address} - \texttt{0xffff880000000000}
$$

After initialization of DMAS and those arrays, the Buddy System is built, also using virtual address in DMAS. Then the cache for page table management is built up, by allocating the memory from the Buddy System. Then the SLAB System is built, also by applying the APIs of Buddy System.

## APIs and Algorithms behind Them
### Basic Memory Management
for every $4\texttt{KB}$ page, there is a structure to manage its attributes, physics address and numbers of reference. A zone struct manage the pages that belongs to it and the general attribute of these pages, like the reference number, free page number and active page number. each bit of the bitmap stores whether this page is allocated or not. This basic management structure is temporary used to manage the memory that used to build the Buddy System and page table of DMAS.

**PS**
- This management system can only manage the pages in the range of DMAS.
- No API for releasing pages.
- Once the buddy system is built up, it is invalid to use this system, excepts the ``BsMemManage_setPageAttr(Page *, u64 attr)`` and ``BsMemMange_getPageAttr(Page *)``.

**APIs**:
```c
// initialize this system
void BsMemManage_init()
// allocate NUM pages and set the attributes of them to ATTR
Page *BsMemManage_alloc(int num, int attr) 
// get the attribute of PAGE
u64 BsMemManage_getPageAttr(Page *page);
// set the attribute of PAGE to ATTR
void BsMemManage_setPageAttr(Page *page, u64 attr);
```

### Buddy System
This system divides the pages into groups, whose size a power of 2. These group is called page frame. Let $S_f=\log_2(\text{the number of pages in the page frame }f)$. We say that $f$ is in the **frame group** $i$ if and only if $S_f=i$ . Due to the limitation of kernel memory used, $S_f\in [0, 11]$. In one page frame, the first page is called **head page**. Kernel and Users can allocate and free a **whole** page frame. All the pages in one allocated page frame has the same attribute, which is stored in the head page of this page frame. Furthermore, the head page has an attribute call ``Page_Flag_HeadPage`` , while the others don't.

Two basic operations of this system is "division" and "merger". Division is to split a page frame into two buddy page frames, who sizes are the same, while the "merger" it to merge two buddy page frames into a larger page frame. It is be noticed that two buddy page frames are called buddies is not because of the same size of them, and the true reason is that their are "born" from the same page frame.

When initializing this system, the page frame will be merged to ensure that the number is page frames is minimum. When it is asked to allocate a page frame, while there is no page frames that meet its requirement of size, the system will divide a page frame which is larger than the requirement recursively, and get the prefix of it to allocate. When a page frame is going to be released, the system will try to merge recursively when its buddy is also free.

The algorithm for finding the buddy of one page is using the numbering method which is similar to that of segment tree. Another important part is use a bitmap to manage whether the states of allocation (allocated/free) of one pages and their buddies are the same. One page and its buddy share the same bit. When one page is allocated or released, that bit will be reversed.

**APIs**:
```c
void Buddy_init();
Page *Buddy_alloc(int log2Size, u64 attr);
void Buddy_free(Page *);
```

### Page Table
This system manages the PGD, PUP, PMD, PLD entries and includes the allocation and releasing of page table. Like Slab system, a cache pool is used. When the size of this cache pool meets the minimum, a page frame will be allocated using Buddy System and the size of cache pool will reach its maximum. When a page table is released and the size of the cache pool exceeds the maximum, then the page that contains this page table will be directly released to Buddy System.

**APIs**:
```c
void PageTable_init();
void PageTable_map(u64 vAddr, u64 pAddr); // map a memory block [pAddr, pAddr + Page_4KSize - 1] to [vAddr, vAddr + page_4KSize - 1]
void PageTable_unmap(u64 vAddr);
```

### SLAB
This system contains a series of cache pool differentiated by size. from $2^5 \texttt{B}, 2^6 \texttt{B}... 1\texttt{MB}$ . There will be numbers of memory blocks in each cache pool, which sizes are all $2\texttt{MB}$ , Thus one memory block can allocate $\frac{2\texttt{MB}}{\text{Size of the pool that this block belongs to}}$, Additionally, when a memory block is completely free, and the numbers of free objects the pool that this block belongs to is higher than $\frac{3}{2}\times (\text{numbers of free objects of this block})$, then this block will be released. When a pool runs out of free objects, then a new memory block will be allocated from Buddy System.

Additionally, since this system only used in kernel program, the virtual address of allocated memory block is always in DMAS range.

**APIs**:
```c
void SLAB_init();
void *kmalloc(u64 size, u64 arg);
void free(void *addr);
```
